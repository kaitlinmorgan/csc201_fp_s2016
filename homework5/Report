#Report for Homework 5 (Final Project)

The objectives of this project are to implement functions that take data from
election polls and predict things about the next election or spit back data
about previous elections to help find a pattern that may lend itself to the
prediction of an upcoming election.  Each function sorts a portion of the
collected data in a specific way and all of them work together in the main
function to make the election predictions.

The row_to_edge function takes in a row of poll data for a state, comparing
Democrat and Republican percents and subtracting them to print the Democratic
edge (the difference between the two).  The state_edges function finds the
Democratic edge all in one go based on the dictionary list of election results.
The main variables these two rely on are "Dem" the democratic results and "Rep"
the republican results.  State lists are also included.  The earlier_date
functiontests if a first specified date ("date1") occurs before a second date
("date2") and returns true if yes.  The  most_recent_poll_date function
tells the most recent row of election results based on a poll and state.  The
varriable "poll_rows" is a list of the rows of poll data, "pollster" is the poll,
and "state" is the specific state.  The unique_column_values function returns all
unique values in a specified column.  The "column_name" variable specifies the
column to which to apply this function and the "unique_list" list takes all of
the found unique values and puts them in a new list.  The pollster_predictions
function predicts data based on row data for the most recent poll for a particular
state.  The variable "poll_rows" is a lists of data from polls.  The avergae_error
function looks at the predicted democratic edges for states (state_edges_predicted)
and compares them to the actual calculation for the democratic error
(state_edges_actual).  It prints the average between the two percents.  The
pollster_errors function finds the predictions (pollster_predictions) and actual
state data (state_edges_actual) and calculates the poll error.

This program was fairly straightforward although I didn't get many of the results
I was hoping for when testing and a few errors.  I think what through me off
most was the intense amount of reading.  It took me a while to sort through all
the chit chat portions to find out what the functions were actually supposed to
do and the tips it offered didn't always feel too helpful.  The whole thing
was way over explained and as a result left me confused at times and wondering
why this wasn't just expressed in a few sentences without all the excess and
virtually unneeded information.  I understand quite a bit of it was necessary,
but my biggest problem was usually when I didn't understand what the packet
was trying to get across or the commentary within the actual program itself
felt unclear.
